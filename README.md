# hngx_second_project

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

I utilized the concept of passing argument and parameters from one page to the other, also, i used initstate to set the values of the arguments to the text property of the controller of the TextFormField.
I used MediaQuery for responsiveness, also, i used push replacement Navigator to close the stack of screens.
